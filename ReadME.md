# How to start
1. open visual studio with project ImageProccesor.
2. Turn on Developer mode if its not already
3. turn on the release verion.
# Notes to the program
* No picture is selected on start of the program
* pictures are saved in current running directory "\ImageProccesor\bin\Release\net6.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win10-x64\AppX\SavedImages" (number windows can be diffrent) 
* (Sadly I havent found folderpicker working for maui with .NET 6, only with .NET 7)
 
* Starting the program will install the app ImageProccesor on the computer. After finishing with review, I recommend to uninstall it.
